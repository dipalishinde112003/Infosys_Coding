You are given an integer array arr[] of size n, representing n number of people in a party, each person is denoted by an integer. Couples are represented by the same number ie: two people have the same integer value, it means they are a couple. Find out the only single person in the party of couples.
Note: It is guarantee that there exist only one single person in the party.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 3
Explaination: Only the number 3 is single.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6] 
Output: 4 
Explaination: 4 is the only single.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 3, 3, 2] 
Output: 2

class Solution {
  public:
    int findSingle(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
        {
            ans=ans^arr[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
